Block-level Elements

A block-level element always starts on a new line.

A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

A block level element has a top and a bottom margin, whereas an inline element does not.

The <div> element is a block-level element.


Here are the block-level elements in HTML:

<address>       <article>       <sdide>             <blockquote>

<canvas>        <dd>            <div>               <dl>

<dt>            <fieldset>      <figcaption>        <figure>

<footer>        <form>          <h1>-<h6>           <header>

<hr>            <li>            <main>              <nav>

<noscript>      <ol>            <p>                 <pre>

<section>       <table>         <tfoor>             <ul>
